db_cinnection branch contains the "todo" stitch example. We were following this tutorial online https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/tutorials/todo-android/ to setup the build cradle. From the tutorial, we were able
to build the "todo" app. 

Todo App - built in android app with the title todo.
Application1 - LogIn interface that takes in username/email and password of user. Has potential for authentication and backend. Does 
not implement and build stitcher. 

Link to QR code feature - https://github.com/dlazaro66/QRCodeReaderView. Would like to add this to Application1. 

Idea: bjdatabases
  - remove paper resumes from career fairs
  - employers scan QR code on applicant's phone to receive their resume
